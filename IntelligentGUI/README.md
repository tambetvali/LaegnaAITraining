# Intelligent GUI Guide

This section provides a practical, graphical‑first introduction to preparing your knowledge for AI training.  
It is written for **all users**, regardless of technical background, and follows the same structure and alignment style as the *IntelligentMistune* documentation.

The goal of this guide is simple:  
**you already have the most important part — your documents and your flashcards.**  
What remains is technical, but not creatively difficult, and modern AI tools can assist you step‑by‑step.

Below are the four chapters of this GUI‑focused workflow.

### 📘 1. Preparing the Document Collection  
**`doccollectionforfinetuning.md`**

A complete introduction to gathering your documents, importing PDFs and DOCX files, creating Markdown files, and building a clean folder structure.  
This chapter explains how to turn an unorganized set of files into a structured, AI‑ready document collection.

👉 [Open doccollectionforfinetuning.md](./doccollectionforfinetuning.md)

### 🧩 2. From Project to Flashcards  
**`project2flashcards.md`**

This chapter explains how to transform your project into flashcards — not just for studying, but as a **deep AI study tool**.  
Flashcards allow an AI to learn your material in a contemplative, structured way, beyond the surface‑level behavior of simple RAG systems.

### 🧠 3. Working With Flashcards  
**`flashcardsflashcards.md`**

Once flashcards exist, you can refine them, reorganize them, and prepare them for machine‑level formats.  
This chapter explains how to work with flashcards in graphical tools before converting them into JSON or other low‑level formats for fine‑tuning.

👉 [Open flashcardsflashcards.md](./flashcardsflashcards.md)

### 🛠️ 4. End‑User Skills and AI Assistance  
**`enduserskills.md`**

Many users assume advanced abilities are required — but this is not the case.  
This chapter explains how **AI becomes your technical assistant**, and how users of all levels (common users, hobbyists, administrators, programmers) can set up and maintain the environment without re‑installation or deep expertise.

## Why This GUI Guide Exists

While building this training system, I realized something important:  
**many people believe they need advanced skills, long‑term memory, or deep technical experience to work with AI training.**  
In reality, the essential part — the human part — is the document collection and the flashcards.  
Everyone is capable of creating and organizing knowledge.

This GUI guide was added to make that clear:  
**you do not need to be advanced to build a meaningful AI system.**  
You only need your documents, your understanding, and a willingness to follow practical steps.  
The rest — conversion, formatting, fine‑tuning — can be guided by AI itself.
