This repository will contain the "obvious basics" of AI training, and it's meant to inspire you: understand, what it means to bring your new knowledge and source creation to an AI, rather than new documents and document collections using well-known formats and structures.

Rather than collecting all kinds of information about RAG, fine-tuning and training here, and I have very small experience in training and fine-tuning, but I have been constantly resolving problems and tracking down the simple, essential idea - from implementation to practice.

My ready-made experience is such: it's hard to bring an innovative information to an AI without becoming somewhat experienced with some fine-tuning tools. You run into many problems of this lacking end-user support. A few web bots do this automatically on new information.

# Fine-tuning patterns

To enter into the problems of lacking a conscious attention of an AI - training and fine doing -, having it running on routine patterns instead - RAG and other kinds of runtime memory -, you would run into goals of having your word understood.

You have the basic problems, identity patterns:
- **Minus**: [It does not understand your new vocabulary](Patterns/vocabulary.md).
- **Minus**: [It does not match your patterns properly](Patterns/rhythym.md).
- **Minus**: [It's short-term contextual memory is weak](Patterns/compression.md).
- **Plus**: [It still extracts the basic meanings from your text, which are consistent with it's patterns](Patterns/traditional.md).

Experiencing these patterns in *RAG* and local memory, you enter into the goals of implementing **training** and *fine-tuning* techniques and practices, which are not very automatic and clearly defined yet, for general community.

Read the texts to dive into the problems you are going to experience before you strongly choose towards techniques to get AI into conscious learning process.

# Fine-tuning compared to local context and lack of context

Structured data formats, such as database schemas and strict standards, are hard to manage as they run into exceptions and paradigms, so in this ancient word you become official, losing your soul and spirit. A.I. is a machine spirit: it combines metal, aether and space to give your spirit an automata.

You have to be agnostic, in your formats, for the ways you use your documentation:
